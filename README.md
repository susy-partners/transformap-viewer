Do not edit the CSS file in styles/css/style.css, edit styles/less/style.less and compile to css.

Install node *less* compiler to convert the stylesheet to less css:

* Debian: `aptitude install node-less`

Compile it via :

    lessc -x styles/less/style.less styles/css/style.css

## Dependencies

Install *bower* from npm:

    [sudo] npm install -g bower

Debian: install npm:

    [sudo] aptitude install npm nodejs-legacy

Fetch external dependencies:

    bower install

## Deployment

The site can be viewed on https://susy-partners.github.io/transformap-viewer/ . Just push the branch gh-pages to update the site.

Notes: for libraries used with bower, add a static copy of the files to the gh-pages branch to its location in bower_components/ (and add an exception to the .gitignore-file).

### build concatenated and minified js/css

Run `npm install` once to install needed development dependencies.

Then, run `npm run build` each time js and/or css has been changed to update the content in the `/dist` folder.

## Style guide

We use spaces (2) instead of tabs, please also use this convention.
